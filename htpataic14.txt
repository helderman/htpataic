<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>14. Multiple nouns</h2>
<p class="intro">
Time to prove the new parser is really capable of
interpreting more complex commands.
</p>
<p>
So far, our parser only accepted simple verb-noun commands.
Let&rsquo;s try and parse some more complex commands like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>get coin from box</li>
<li>put coin in box</li>
<li>ask coin from guard</li>
<li>give coin to guard</li>
</ul>
<p>
Adding patterns to <i>parsexec.c</i> seems straightforward:
</p>
<ul>
<li>get A from B</li>
<li>put A in B</li>
<li>ask A from B</li>
<li>give A to B</li>
</ul>
<p>
But as explained in the previous chapter, similar commands
(like &lsquo;get A from B&rsquo; and the already existing &lsquo;get A&rsquo;)
must be placed in the correct order.
If &lsquo;get A&rsquo; would appear first,
then it would consume <i>any</i> command starting with &lsquo;get&rsquo;,
including all those that were supposed to be matched by the new pattern.
In short, &lsquo;get A from B&rsquo; must come before &lsquo;get A&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Some commands (for example <i>put</i>) do not have a single-noun variant.
Nevertheless, we will add a pattern with a single nonterminal
(&lsquo;put A&rsquo;).
We need this to correctly capture a misspelled noun.
The full pattern &lsquo;put A in B&rsquo;
will not match a command like &lsquo;put koin in box&rsquo;.
As explained in the previous chapter,
only a nonterminal at the end of a pattern
is able to capture a misspelled or otherwise unrecognized noun.
</p>
<p>
The same applies to commands with more than two nouns.
With <i>n</i> nouns,
you need <i>n</i> patterns to handle all possible mismatches.
An example with three parameters:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>&ldquo;paint A on B with C&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;paint A on B&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;paint A&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, the order of the patterns is vital:
if &ldquo;paint A&rdquo; would be on top (meaning it will be tried first),
then it would consume every <i>paint</i> command,
including those that were meant to be caught by 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>
For now, we do not need patterns with more than two nonterminals.
</p>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test 14
</td></tr>
</table>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>parsexec.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 14 parsexec.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>parsexec.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 14 parsexec.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
In a new module <i>inventory2.c</i>, we implement the new multi-noun commands
<i>get</i>, <i>drop/put</i>, <i>ask</i> and <i>give</i>.
Now we can finally put the gold coin back in the box!
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>inventory2.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#ldiff 14 inventory2.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>inventory2.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 14 inventory2.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
You may notice that commands like &lsquo;put coin in forest&rsquo;
and &lsquo;put coin in box&rsquo; (when the box is closed)
get the following strange reply:
&ldquo;That is way too heavy.&rdquo;
That is because most objects
(including the closed box, and scenary like the forest)
have zero capacity to hold other objects.
Rightfully so, but the message is quite inappropriate.
To avoid that, we will introduce a separate message
for objects that have zero capacity:
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit in.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
However, that particular message is totally misleading
when it comes as a response to &lsquo;put key in box&rsquo;.
So we will make a special exception for that particular combination of objects.

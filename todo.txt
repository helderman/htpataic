- ch17: do a serious performance test!
- noun.c getPossession: getting/asking from actor or from dead object
- move.c reachableObject: eliminate 'default:'

- ch08: besides n/e/s/w, also up/down, nw, ne, sw, se
- ch15: look <any object in possession>, in dark, gives too much visible detail
- ch17: more about gcov
- ch17: improve test coverage (testscript.txt)
- include makefile; see also ch17 test automation
- ch17: expect is a good alternative
- Q+A in stackoverflow: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/running-gcov-when-executable-has-command-line-input-options-866269/

- ch13/14: too much repetition of explanation about order of patterns?
- ch14+15 multi-noun; see below (originally move.txt) for ideas

	go/look A	- any A visible to player
	open/close A	- any A visible to player
	light A		- any A visible to player
	get A		- any A visible to player
	get A from B	- A must be in B
	ask A		- (special) any A visible to (or in?) actorHere
	ask A from B	- (special) any A visible to (or in?) B
	drop A		- A must be in player
	put A in B	- A must be in player
	give A		- A must be in player
	give A to B	- A must be in player

- order of objects
- ch15: "light lamp"
- ch15: attribute 'light'?
- ch15: you see no south
- ch15: also an example of a light switch

- object.awk: default for tags should be "\" \""

- ch3: use pointers instead of i, and introduce noun.c already
- ch4: calculate endOfObjs

- command 'ask': make a separate function isNiceActor

- ch8: also up, down, north-east...
- ch9: compass directions in the generated map

new chapter 14: multiple arguments
because there is more to it than just the parser:
- order of patterns
- breadth-first distance handling
- difficult semantics; how to respond to "put key in door"?
ch14: you can ask silver from guard when you are in the cave;
      you can get gold from box when you are in the field
ch14: 2-param get/put have same impl as ask/give; must refine
change argument for introducing 2-param commands: put gold in box

sort object.txt

copyright/copyleft

ch15: listObjectsAtLocation: make visible light exit in dark location
ch15: cannot see cave exit; can "go <location>" between dark locations
ch15: "turn on lamp" works, "turn lamp on" does not

more chapters:
12. Open and close
- uitleg rugzak, en andere objecten die meeliften met objecten (coin + eagle)
13. A different parser
- case-insensitive, multiple spaces ("silver coin", ch8)
- something about distUnknownObject (see ch7)
- new struct: object, tag, distance, isDuplicate, passage?
- yacc!
14. light+dark
- a typical feature for games that involve dungeon exploration (Adventure/Zork)
- an attribute 'light' that is set in 2 objects: field + torch
- can only 'look' if there is any lit object with distance < distOverthere
- same for other commands (go, get) - maybe increase distance of objects?
  - distanceTo: swap 3rd and 4th test, and put 'light' check in between
    (checking whether obj->location is lit, or contains a lit object)
- commands 'light' and 'dim' (?); only work on torch --> swapLocation like ch12
- the lamp gets exhausted; this is a sense of 'time'!
15. Savegame
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game
- save the whole objs (+ any other state vars)
  - optimization: only save what is subject to change (location, health)
    - note that location has been used for the state of doors and light too
    - skip pointers, for safety!
  - add a checksum to prevent manipulation
  - or use checkpointing software like CryoPID
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_checkpointing
- alternative: save log instead of state
  - or use a test automation tool
16. Abbreviations (n,e,s,w,u,d,inv; x/exam???)
17. Conversations
- http://www.scribd.com/doc/17682546/Dynamic-Conversation-Engine-Concept
18. How simple it is to add commands (push/pull, move x to y) - refer to ch5
- also: combat!
- maybe rather focus on combat in ch18, plus discuss 'time' (turn-based vs real-time)
- discuss random (like dice in RPG); explain problem with log (ch16); solve by logging seed
19. Performance, space (refer to/from ch6)
20. Database (sqlite)
- replace function pointers (ch11) by enums; have object.awk generate a switch
21. Speech
22. Javascript

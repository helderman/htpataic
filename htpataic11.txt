<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>11. Conditions</h2>
<p class="intro">
So far, all the objects&rsquo; attributes were data: text, numbers.
But attributes may just as well be code.
</p>
<p>
In the previous chapter, we limited the player&rsquo;s freedom of movement
by closing the cave entrance (passage <i>intoCave</i>).
This already makes the game a lot more challenging,
but it does not make much of a puzzle,
unless we offer a tiny possibility for the player to <b>open the passage</b>.
The real challenge should be for the player
to find the <b>condition</b> under which the passage opens.
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s take a simple example.
To get past the guard and enter the cave,
the player has to either kill or bribe the guard
(or both, for what it&rsquo;s worth).
In other words:
<ul>
<li>when the guard is dead (health = 0), the entrance is <b>open</b></li>
<li>when the guard is holding the silver coin, the entrance is <b>open</b></li>
<li>when neither is the case, the entrance is <b>closed</b></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Opening a closed passage (in this case <i>intoCave</i>)
involves changing a number of attribute values:
<ul>
<li><b>destination</b>
changes from <i>NULL</i> to <i>cave</i>
</li>
<li><b>textGo</b>
changes from
<i>&lsquo;the guard stops you...&rsquo;</i>
to
<i>&lsquo;you walk into the cave&rsquo;</i>
</li>
<li><b>description</b> and <b>detail</b>
need not change in this particular case;
but for a doorway or grating,
either one (or both) would typically contain some text that changes
from <i>&lsquo;open&rsquo;</i> to <i>&lsquo;closed&rsquo;</i>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There are a number of ways to accomplish this.
Here, I will discuss an approach that is simple, maintainable and versatile.
</p>
<p>
First of all, we define two separate passages:
one that represents the <i>open</i> passage,
and the other representing the <i>closed</i> passage.
The passages are identical in every attribute except for the ones listed above.
(In the generated map you see below,
notice the two arrows leading into the cave; one solid, one dashed.)
</p>
<p>
Next, we introduce a new attribute named <b>condition</b>
that determines whether or not a certain object exists.
The two passages will be given
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_exclusive#Logic">mutually exclusive</a>
conditions, so that only one of them can exist at any given time.
</p>
<p>
Each condition will be implemented as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean-valued_function">boolean-valued function</a>;
<i>true</i> means the object exists, <i>false</i> means it does not.
</p>

<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">bool intoCaveIsOpen(void)
{
   return guard-&gt;health == 0 || silver-&gt;location == guard;
}

bool intoCaveIsClosed(void)
{
   return guard-&gt;health &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; silver-&gt;location != guard;
}
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The new attribute <i>condition</i> is a pointer to such a function:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">bool (*condition)(void);
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
After some small modifications to <i>object.awk</i>,
similar to those made in the previous chapter,
we can immediately start assigning functions to the new attribute
in <i>object.txt</i>.
</p>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test 11
</td></tr>
</table>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">- intoCave
     condition   <span class="red">intoCaveIsOpen</span>
     description "a cave entrance to the east"
     tags        "east", "entrance"
     location    field
     <span class="red">destination</span> cave
     detail      "The entrance is just a narrow opening in a small outcrop.\n"
     textGo      <span class="red">"You walk into the cave.\n"</span>

- intoCaveBlocked
     condition   <span class="red">intoCaveIsClosed</span>
     description "a cave entrance to the east"
     tags        "east", "entrance"
     location    field
     <span class="red">prospect</span>    cave
     detail      "The entrance is just a narrow opening in a small outcrop.\n"
     textGo      <span class="red">"The guard stops you from walking into the cave.\n"</span>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The two &lsquo;condition&rsquo; functions are so specific,
each of them is used just this once.
Now, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to define the functions right where we need them?
Many programming languages support
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous functions</a>;
something like this:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">- intoCave
     condition   <span class="red">{ return guard-&gt;health == 0 || silver-&gt;location == guard; }</span>
     ...

- intoCaveBlocked
     condition   <span class="red">{ return guard-&gt;health &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; silver-&gt;location != guard; }</span>
     ...
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Plain C does not allow this,
but since <i>object.txt</i> is a product of our own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a>
(see chapter 9),
we can do anything we like!
That is, if we can make the code generator
turn it into something the C compiler will swallow.
The following adjustments to <i>object.awk</i> will do just that.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.awk</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 11 object.awk
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 8, 16:
most objects are unconditional;
their condition is a trivial function that always returns <i>true</i>.
</li>
<li>Line 35-38:
an anonymous function (anything starting with a curly brace)
is replaced by a function with a generated name;
the name is the attribute name (in this case <i>condition</i>)
followed by a number (the object count).
This technique is similar to the way we handle tags (lines 67 and 73).
</li>
<li>Line 55-56:
so far, our program contains five
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loops</a>,
each of which needs to be expanded with an embedded condition check.
To avoid having to write (and maintain) the same code many times, I defined
a macro that encapsulates the <i>for</i> statement and the condition check.
It replaces the original <i>for</i> statement in a transparent way;
there is no need for an additional pair of curly braces
surrounding the loop&rsquo;s body, despite the additional <i>if</i> statement.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
So now we can add the extra passage and the conditions to <i>object.txt</i>,
as explained earlier.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.txt</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 11 object.txt
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
To make the conditions work, we need to adjust function <i>getDistance</i>,
plus every loop that scans through objects.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>misc.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 11 misc.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
There is one more object loop to be fixed, in <i>noun.c</i>:
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>noun.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 11 noun.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, there is no way the guard will die.
So you might say
the &lsquo;health check&rsquo; in our condition functions is quite useless.
Of course, this is easily fixed by adding a <i>kill</i> command;
see chapter 20.
</li>
<li>The two condition functions are complementary; they qualify as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">duplicate code</a>.
To eliminate that, we might decide to make one function call the other
(with the &lsquo;!&rsquo; operator to negate the result).
An anonymous function has no (stable) name,
but we can refer to it by its object.
We could replace the condition function of <i>intoCaveBlocked</i> by:
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">{ return <span class="red">!</span>(*intoCave-&gt;condition)(); }
</td>
</tr></table>
</li>
<li>For simplicity, the condition functions have no parameter.
It might actually be better to pass a parameter <i>OBJECT *obj</i>;
that makes it possible to write more generic condition functions
that can be re-used across multiple objects.
</li>
<li>In theory, any object can be made &lsquo;conditional&rsquo;.
In practice, its main benefit lies with passages.
But in the next chapter,
you can see a similar technique being applied to an item.
</li>

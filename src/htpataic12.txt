<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>12. Open and close</h2>
<p class="intro">
In the previous chapter,
we used &lsquo;condition&rsquo; functions to make objects disappear.
But of course, there is a much simpler way to achieve the same:
just clear the object&rsquo;s <i>location</i> attribute!
</p>
<p>
The cave entrance was a typical example
where <b>condition functions</b> work particularly well.
This is because the entrance is affected by attributes in <i>other</i> objects
(the guard and the silver coin);
the functions make it possible to keep all the logic together.
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s take a more straightforward example.
Suppose the cave has a door leading to a backroom.
Just a simple doorway, which the player can open and close.
Just like in the previous chapter, we will use two objects for the passage;
one to represent the open door, and another for when it is closed.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">- backroom
     description "a backroom"
     tags        "backroom"
     details     "The room is dusty and messy.\n"

- openDoorToBackroom
     description "an open door to the south"
     tags        "south", "door", "doorway"<span class="red">
     destination backroom</span>
     details     "The door is open.\n"
     textGo      "You walk through the door into the backroom.\n"

- closedDoorToBackroom
     description "a closed door to the south"
     tags        "south", "door", "doorway"<span class="red">
     location    cave
     prospect    backroom</span>
     details     "The door is closed.\n"
     textGo      "The door is closed.\n"
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Naturally, the door should be accessible from the other side as well.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">- openDoorToCave
     description "an open door to the north"
     tags        "north", "door", "doorway"<span class="red">
     destination cave</span>
     details     "The door is open.\n"
     textGo      "You walk through the door into the cave.\n"

- closedDoorToCave
     description "a closed door to the north"
     tags        "north", "door", "doorway"<span class="red">
     location    backroom
     prospect    cave</span>
     details     "The door is closed.\n"
     textGo      "The door is closed.\n"
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Notice I only gave the closed doorways a location; the open ones have none.
So initially, the door is closed
(hence the dashed arrows between cave and backroom
in the generated map you see on the right).
To open the door, all we have to do is swap the locations.
</p>
#map
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">openDoorToBackroom-&gt;location = cave;
closedDoorToBackroom-&gt;location = NULL;
openDoorToCave-&gt;location = backroom;
closedDoorToCave-&gt;location = NULL;
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s create a helper function to accommodate this.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">void swapLocations(OBJECT *obj1, OBJECT *obj2)
{
   OBJECT *tmp = obj1-&gt;location;
   obj1-&gt;location = obj2-&gt;location;
   obj2-&gt;location = tmp;
}
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Now the following statements can be used to open the door;
and once it is open, the same statements will close it again.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">swapLocations(openDoorToBackroom, closedDoorToBackroom);
swapLocations(openDoorToCave, closedDoorToCave);
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The helper function is particularly convenient
when the object in question is <i>movable</i>.
For example, a <b>box</b> can be opened and closed,
but it is also an item that can be picked up and moved elsewhere.
In other words, its location is not fixed.
Function <i>swapLocations</i> does not rely on a fixed location,
since it passes the current location back and forth between two objects.
</p>
<p>
Of course, a box is not a passage;
the player is always on the outside, so a single pair of objects will suffice,
and so will a single call to <i>swapLocations</i>.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">swapLocations(openBox, closedBox);
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
This is more or less all we need
to implement some new commands <i>open</i> and <i>close</i>.
Below is a simple implementation of <i>open</i>;
the implementation of <i>close</i> is similar.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">OBJECT *obj = parseObject(noun);
if (obj == closedDoorToBackRoom || obj == closedDoorToCave)
{<span class="red">
   swapLocations(openDoorToBackroom, closedDoorToBackroom);
   swapLocations(openDoorToCave, closedDoorToCave);</span>
   printf("OK.\n");
}
else if (obj == closedBox)
{<span class="red">
   swapLocations(openBox, closedBox);</span>
   printf("OK.\n");
}
else if (obj == openDoorToBackRoom || obj == openDoorToCave || obj == openBox)
{
   printf("That is already open.\n");
}
else
{
   printf("That cannot be opened.\n");
}
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
To make things slightly more complicated,
we can put a <b>lock</b> on the door or on the box.
This requires (at least) <i>three</i> mutually exclusive objects;
one for each of the possible states:
<i>open</i>, <i>closed</i> and <i>locked</i>.
But we can still use the same function to swap locations of the objects.
For example, here&rsquo;s how to unlock a locked box; and vice versa.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">swapLocations(closedBox, lockedBox);
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
There is some overhead involved in the other commands.
Our implementation of command <i>open</i> must be expanded
to handle the new object <i>lockedBox</i>:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">...
else if (obj == lockedBox)
{
   printf("You can't, it is locked.\n");
}
...
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
It may be clear that the number of lines of code
is proportional to the number of doors in the game
(and boxes and other objects that can be opened).
So if your game has more than just a handful of doors,
then it is a good idea to go for a more generic solution.
By the way, this is something that goes for every command:
when it concerns a good many objects, try to write generic code;
but when you are dealing with one or two special cases,
just stick to straightforward, specialized code.
</p>
<p>
Generic code typically comes with a data-driven approach.
In other words,
we need to add one or more attributes to our object structure.
In this particular case, we will be adding a function pointer
for each of the commands we wish to support:
<i>open</i>, <i>close</i>, <i>lock</i> and <i>unlock</i>.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.txt</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff object.txt
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 88:
at first sight, <i>isAlreadyOpen</i> may seem inappropriate here;
technically, <i>intoCaveBlocked</i> is a closed passage.
But storywise, it is still an opening.
</li>
<li>Line 168, 179, 190:
If you prefer a heavy treasure chest instead of a box,
then all you have to do is increase the weight
(and adjust the relevant text and tags accordingly).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
To avoid
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">duplicate code</a>,
I deliberately did <i>not</i> use anonymous functions this time.
Instead, we will implement the necessary logic in a separate module.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>toggle.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff toggle.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>toggle.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff toggle.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
As announced earlier, the implementations of the four commands
<i>open</i>, <i>close</i>, <i>lock</i> and <i>unlock</i>
are totally generic.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>openclose.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff openclose.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>openclose.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff openclose.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Above, I used a generic function <i>reachableObject</i>
to handle objects that are not here;
see below for its implementation.
This way, we don&rsquo;t have to write the same code four times
(once for every <i>execute</i> function).
More commands will be added in chapter 15;
these will benefit from the same function.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>reach.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff reach.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>reach.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff reach.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The necessary modifications to <i>object.awk</i> are very straightforward:
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.awk</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff object.awk
</td>
</tr></table>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The additions to <i>parsexec.c</i> are equally straightforward.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>parsexec.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff parsexec.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>You may have noticed that <i>object.txt</i> has almost doubled in size
in this chapter.
I can already promise you, this is only the beginning.
<i>object.txt</i> is our main source of game data;
once we seriously start adding locations, items and actors,
the number of lines could easily grow to many thousands.
</li>
<li>Function <i>swapLocation</i>
can be used for many other things than doors and locks.
In chapter 15, it will be used again, this time to turn the light on and off.
</li>
<li>As you can see in the sample output,
the player can get the gold from the box,
but he is unable to put it back in again!
Our parser cannot handle &lsquo;complex&rsquo; commands like
<i>put coin in box</i>.
So in the next chapter, we will write a whole new parser;
the current two-line implementation badly needs replacement!

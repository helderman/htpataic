<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="intro">
This is not a C tutorial; there are plenty of those on the web.
The reader is assumed to have some basic knowledge of programming in general,
and preferrably the C programming language in particular.
Maybe you just finished reading a tutorial somewhere,
and you would like to learn some more about programming
by studying other people&rsquo;s source code.
Or could it be that you really are genuinely interested in
the ancient art of writing text adventure games from scratch?
Maybe you are just having a sense of nostalgia about the old days,
when life was simple, and so was software.
In either case, you have come to the right place.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_adventure">text adventures</a>
were a respectable genre of computer games.
But times have changed:
in the 21st century, they pale in comparison with modern
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmorpg">MMORPGs</a> with 3D engines.
Where books survived the rise of film,
text-based games quickly lost the battle against their graphical counterparts.
&lsquo;Interactive fiction&rsquo; is kept alive by an active community,
but its commercial value is long gone.
</p>
<p>
There is a bright side to this:
authoring tools of professional quality are now available free of charge.
This is also the single biggest advice I can give you
if you intend to write your own adventure:
use one of the many dedicated
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_adventure#Development_systems">development systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
But then, why this tutorial?
Why write an adventure game using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose programming language</a>?
Because doing so can be entertaining, challenging and educational.
The programming language
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>
may not be the most obvious choice for writing a text adventure;
it&rsquo;s nothing like LISP-based languages like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_programming_language">MDL</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_Implementation_Language">ZIL</a>.
But while writing my own humble text adventure,
I learned that C fits the bill quite well.
</p>
<p>
The ideas you find here apply not only to C
but to other programming languages as well.
If you prefer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
over C, it should not be too difficult to translate my code samples.
</p>
<p>
I tried to keep this tutorial readable for a broad audience,
without too much off-topic elaboration.
For terms that might warrant further explanation,
please follow the hyperlinks to relevant
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> articles.

<h3>Incremental development</h3>
<p>
Throughout this tutorial,
we will be developing a fully functional text adventure game.
This will be done in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model">incremental</a>
fashion.
With every chapter, some code is added to our program.
Each increment, however small, adds some value to the game.
And every time, the result is a working program,
ready to run once built with a proper C
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>.
</p>
<p>
We start off with just 9 lines of code;
it is little more than a trivial
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program</a>.
If you can&rsquo;t even get this simple example to work,
you should find some help with that first,
before you are ready to move on to the next chapter.

<div class="explanation">
<p>
Some explanation for those not quite familiar with C:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1:
a text adventure needs no fancy libraries; the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">C standard library</a>
is sufficient, and widely available.
But feel free to replace it with any
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:User_interface">user interface</a>
library you like, for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glk_(software)">Glk</a>.
</li>
<li>Line 3:
function
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_function_(programming)">main</a>
is the starting point of a typical C program.
</li>
<li>Line 5-7:
output text to the screen; the escape sequence <tt>\n</tt> represents a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">newline</a>.
</li>
<li>Line 8:
function <i>main</i> returns a zero
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_code">exit code</a>
to indicate the program completed successfully.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
Trivial as it may be, the program does demonstrate
<i>the</i> most important aspect of any text adventure:
descriptive text.
A good story is one of the things that makes a good adventure game.
I deliberately kept it brief in my code sample.
I will focus on the programming aspect of the game,
and leave the rest up to your imagination.

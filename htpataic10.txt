<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>10. More attributes</h2>
<p class="intro">
There are many possible reasons
for expanding the &lsquo;object&rsquo; structure.
</p>
<p>
When we introduced objects in chapter 4, they had only three attributes.
In chapter 6, we added a fourth.
This is more or less the absolute minimum.
To put more detail into our adventure, we need some more attributes.
Here are a few examples.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The command <i>look around</i>
gives a global description of the player&rsquo;s location,
including a list of items, actors and other objects present there.
Many adventures require the player to examine these objects,
either to reveal certain clues that are needed to make progress in the game,
or simply to enhance the game&rsquo;s atmosphere.
We will add an attribute <b>details</b>
that holds a detailed description of each object,
plus an attribute <b>contents</b>
that is used with objects that contain other objects.
</li>
<li>When the player follows a passage,
the response is invariably &ldquo;OK&rdquo;
followed by a description of the new location.
This is a bit dull;
it would be so much nicer to give each passage its own custom message.
We will add an attribute <b>textGo</b> to hold this message.
</li>
<li>Some passages have a &lsquo;twist&rsquo;;
they do not go where the player expects them to go.
For example, a forest path may be hiding a pitfall.
While the passage <i>appears</i> to be leading from location A to location B,
in reality the end point is location C, i.e. the bottom of a pit.
More common &lsquo;twists&rsquo; are passages that are &lsquo;blocked&rsquo;:
a closed grating, a broken bridge, a narrow crack.
Suppose our cave entrance is blocked by the guard.
Any attempt to enter the cave will fail;
instead the player will stay at his original location, i.e. the field.
We could simply change the passage&rsquo;s <i>destination</i>
to <i>field</i> (or <i>NULL</i>),
but that would result in an undesirable response to commands like
<i>go cave</i> and <i>look cave</i>:
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see any cave here.&rdquo;
We need separate attributes for
the <i>actual</i> and the <i>apparent</i> end point of a passage.
We will introduce an attribute <b>prospect</b> to represent the latter;
the attribute <i>destination</i>, introduced in chapter 6,
still holds the <i>actual</i> end point.
In most cases, the two will be equal,
so we will have <i>object.awk</i> generate an appropriate default;
<i>prospect</i> only needs to be specified in <i>object.txt</i>
when it differs from <i>destination</i>.
</li>
<li>In many adventures, the player, as well as other actors in the game,
are limited in how much they can carry.
Give each item a <b>weight</b>;
the combined weight of all items in an actor&rsquo;s inventory
should not exceed that actor&rsquo;s <b>capacity</b>.
Give an object a very high weight to make it immovable
(a tree, a house, a mountain).
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG</a>-style
adventure games will need a whole range of attributes for actors
(both player and non-player), for example <b>health</b>.
Objects with zero health are either dead, or they are not an actor at all.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We define seven new attributes in <i>object.txt</i>:
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.txt</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 object.txt
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 9-15:
the seven new attributes.
</li>
<li>Lines 37 and 44:
the silver and gold coin have the same weight;
in case you find this unrealistic,
feel free to apply a more accurate unit of weight for your objects.
</li>
<li>Lines 52-53 and 61-62:
both the player and the non-player characters
are alive (they have <i>health</i>),
and they have a limited ability to carry objects
(here: the equivalent of 20 coins).
</li>
<li>Line 68:
I am using the cave entrance
to demonstrate the effect of attribute <i>prospect</i>.
Normally, <i>prospect</i> takes on the value of <i>destination</i>
(see <i>object.awk</i> below, specifically line 62).
By specifying <i>prospect</i> instead of <i>destination</i>
(consequently leaving the latter <i>NULL</i>),
we effectively &lsquo;block&rsquo; the cave entrance
without making it disappear.
</li>
<li>Lines 85 and 92:
<i>textGo</i> is useful not only for passages,
but for non-passage objects as well
(in this case the two &lsquo;walls&rsquo; we introduced in chapter 8).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
New attributes also require an adjustment in the code generator.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.awk</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 object.awk
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Now we&rsquo;re all set to start using the new attributes!
<b>details</b> is used in a newly recognized command
<i>look &lt;object&gt;</i>,
and <b>textGo</b> replaces the fixed text <i>&ldquo;OK&rdquo;</i>
in our implementation of command <i>go</i>.
</p>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test 10
</td></tr>
</table>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>location.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 location.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Attributes <b>weight</b> and <b>capacity</b> together become
a possible reason for not being able to move certain objects around.
And a <b>health</b> check replaces the hard-coded whitelist of actors.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>move.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 move.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The weight check makes use of a new function <i>weightOfContents</i>;
it will be implemented in <i>misc.c</i>.
In the same module,
we also make modifications to some of the existing functions,
to support the last few attributes.
</p>
<p>
Attribute <b>contents</b> replaces the fixed text <i>&ldquo;You see&rdquo;</i>.
The original text was already a bit odd
when listing the player&rsquo;s inventory,
but now that function <i>listObjectsAtLocation</i> is used to display
contents of any possible object (see function <i>executeLook</i> above),
we really need something more flexible.
</p>
<p>
By replacing attribute <i>destination</i> by <b>prospect</b>
in function <i>getPassage</i>,
we are improving responses to <i>all</i> commands
(not just <i>go</i> and <i>look</i>)
applied to a location that is seen lying on the other end of
a &lsquo;passage with a twist.&rsquo;
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>misc.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 misc.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>misc.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 misc.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
To make the whole picture complete,
it would be nice to expand the generated map from the previous chapter
with dashed lines for the &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; passages
(leading towards a <b>prospect</b>).
</p>
<img class="genmap" src="genmap10.png" />
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>map.awk</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 10 map.awk
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>Please be aware that more detailed descriptions often warrant
a bigger dictionary (more objects, more tags).
For example, the command <i>look silver coin</i> now returns
<i>&ldquo;The coin has an eagle on the obverse.&rdquo;</i>
Very atmospheric, but it invites the player to &lsquo;drill down&rsquo;
by entering a command <i>look eagle</i>.
To avoid the disgrace of the game having to admit
that it does not actually know what &lsquo;eagle&rsquo; means,
you either have to go for evasive answers
(<i>&ldquo;You see nothing special&rdquo;</i> &ndash;
quite disappointing, really),
or add an &lsquo;ornamental&rsquo; <i>eagle</i> object.
You can use the <i>location</i> attribute to attach the eagle to the coin,
so that the eagle will follow wherever the coin goes.
</li>
<li>Try not to worry too much about the memory space
wasted on attributes that are only used in certain types of objects
(for example, <i>textGo</i> is only used in passages),
or the many duplicate string literals
(especially the default ones generated by <i>object.awk</i>).
We will discuss these issues in chapter 19.
</li>
<li>To demonstrate the use of attribute <i>prospect</i>,
we made the cave inaccessible.
This becomes immediately obvious when you look at the new <i>map.png</i>
(see the picture above);
the arrow going into the cave is dashed,
meaning it is an apparent passage, but not an actual passage.
Rest assured, the cave will be re-opened in the next chapter.
</li>
</ul>
